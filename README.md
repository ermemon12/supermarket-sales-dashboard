# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis – Jupyter + Power BI Project

This is a full-cycle data analytics project where I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Jupyter Notebook**, and then built a fully interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to uncover insights about supermarket sales performance.
